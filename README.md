# sentiment_analysis on Twitter 
This is the project telling how much percentage of positive and negative and neutral tweets on a twitter user.In this project i use textblob which is python package for finding the polarity of a tweet and regular expressions(re) for removing the characters which are unnecessary and also i use tweepy which is special package for twitter to retrieve the tweets.
